Welcome to covid4connect! This is a website I created that asks you a few questions about your covid-19 vaccination status, then provides you with some relevant statistics about the pandemic based on your responses. Depending on your answers, you may also have the opportunity to play a game of 4connect with a friend!

This project was done using React (https://reactjs.org) and the bulma (https://bulma.io) CSS framework and pulls the statistics from several different third-party APIs in real time.
